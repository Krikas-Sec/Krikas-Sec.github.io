# About Me

## Who I Am
My name is **Krikas**, and Iâ€™m the sole developer behind Krikas-Sec. With over 10 years of experience as a system administrator, I am passionate about building open-source tools that simplify workflows, enhance productivity, and empower individuals in the fields of system administration and security.

## My Mission
My mission is to create tools that are simple, efficient, and accessible to everyone. Whether it's helping system administrators automate tasks or giving penetration testers tools to enhance their work, I strive to make a meaningful impact in the tech community.

## My Journey
I started Krikas-Sec as a way to share my knowledge and learn new skills along the way. From programming in languages like Python, Go, and Java to delving into ethical hacking, this journey is as much about self-improvement as it is about giving back to the community.
