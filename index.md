# Welcome to Krikas-Sec

**Krikas-Sec is the home of PowerHack ‚Äî a hacking lab powered by Windows.**
I develop open-source tools and utilities that streamline workflows for sysadmins, developers, and ethical hackers. Here you'll also find writeups and CTF walkthroughs solved entirely from Windows using PowerShell and WSL ‚Äî proving that you don‚Äôt need Linux to hack like a pro.

## **Why Krikas-Sec?**

I created Krikas-Sec to combine my passion for system administration, security, and programming. The goal is to empower professionals and enthusiasts alike with tools that simplify workflows and improve productivity. Every tool is developed with the intention of solving specific problems I've encountered during my years of experience.

*Make hacking smarter ‚Äî not harder.*
